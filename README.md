# Welcome 👋
# 📸 React Native Image Gallery App

A professional-level **React Native image gallery app** built using the **Flickr API**. This app enables users to:

- Explore recent images
- Search for keywords like `cat`, `dog`, etc.
- View full-screen images
- Enjoy smooth navigation with infinite scrolling
- Handle offline support with caching
- Receive user-friendly feedback on network issues with retry options

---

## ✨ Features

- 🖼️ Fetches recent images using the **Flickr API**
- 🔄 **Pagination** support: loads more images on scroll (page 1, 2, 3...)
- 🔍 Powerful **search** by keyword (e.g., "cat", "dog")
- ⚙️ **Drawer Navigation**: Home, Explore, and Search screens
- 📥 Offline image **caching** using `AsyncStorage`
- 💬 Error **Snackbar** with “RETRY” on network failure
- 🔁 Pull-to-refresh support
- 📱 Runs on **Android and iOS**

## 🧠 How It Works

- **Explore Screen:** Uses `flickr.photos.getRecent` with pagination (`page=1`, `page=2`, `page=3`…).
- **Search Screen:** Calls `flickr.photos.search` with a user-entered keyword like “cat”.
- **Drawer Navigation:** Lets users switch between Home, Explore, and Search easily.
- **Offline Cache:** Recently fetched images are stored using `AsyncStorage`.
- **Error Handling:** Network failures are caught and prompt a “Retry” Snackbar.

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
